# Level 1 Task 12 -HTML

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Use Visual Studio Code to create an HTML file called childhood.html in this
folder.

● Set out the basic document template.

● Make the title “My Childhood”

● Make two headings (‘h1’s), with the content being “Hobbies” and “Toys”.

● Each of these headings should have two subheadings of type h2 (total of
four). List two hobbies you had as a child and two of your favourite toys.

● Within these subheadings, create two paragraphs per h2 heading. In each
of these paragraphs, mention a memory that you have about that particular
hobby or toy. You don’t need to make this too long - a sentence is fine
(unless you’re feeling very creative!).

● Be sure to use italics and bold text on your page — you can choose where.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Open the childhood.html file that you created.

● If you have not yet done so, make sure that your webpage contains
appropriate headings and paragraphs.

● Add at least 3 relevant pictures (either from your PC or online) to your
webpage. Don’t worry about the sizes and position for now — we will deal
with that in the CSS section.

● Add a “back to top” link at the bottom of your webpage that will return the
user to the top of the webpage when clicked.

## Task 3

Follow these steps:

● Create an HTML file called tables.html in this folder.

● Set out the basic document template, giving it a title and headings as you
see fit.

● Create a table with 3 columns, with column names in bold. These names
should be: “Topic”, “Name of the website” and “URL”.

● Populate this table with the details of 3 resources that you have found on
the web that provide useful advice for coding in JavaScript. Feel free to use
resources referred to in earlier tasks.
